1. You are given an equation of the form LHS = RHS.
2. LHS is a mathematical expression on real numbers with +, -, * and / operations.
3. RHS is a single numerical value (real number).
4. LHS != RHS

**Given above, modify the LHS such that by adding one or more groups of parenthesis, LHS == RHS.**

Find the Big O time complexity for the algorithm


### Example 1

**Input**

200 - 60 / 5 = 28

**Output**

(200 - 60)/5 = 28

### Example 2

**Input**

12 + 3  * 17 - 3 * 2 = 108

**Output**

(12 + 3  * (17 - 3)) * 108
