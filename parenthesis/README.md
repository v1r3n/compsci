# Problem Statement

1. You are given an equation of the form LHS = RHS.
2. LHS is a mathematical expression on real numbers with +, -, * and / operations.
3. RHS is a single numerical value (real number).
4. LHS != RHS

**Given above, modify the LHS such that by adding one or more groups of parenthesis, LHS == RHS.**


### Example 1
200 - 60 / 5 = 28

(200 - 60)/5 = 28

### Example 2
12 + 3  * 17 - 3 * 2 = 108

(12 + 3  * (17 - 3)) * 108

## Bonus
1. Find the Big O for the solution
2. Find a solution that requires the minimum no. of parenthesis
